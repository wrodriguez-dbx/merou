"""Interfaces used by use cases to talk to backend services.

Defines general interfaces to use to talk to backend application services (storage, authorization,
user, group, permission, and so forth) that are shared among multiple use cases.  Also defines the
exceptions they throw, if needed.

Do not define UI interfaces to talk to frontends here.  There should be a one-to-one correspondance
between UI interfaces and use cases, so the UI interface is defined in the same file with the use
case.

By convention, all class names here end in Interface or Exception.
